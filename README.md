# SudokuSolver
Read the repository name

My love for sudoku and desire to learn Python lead to this application.
Currently the application takes a sudoku puzzle as a csv file input and resolves it. 
Haven't gotten around to thinking about how i will display the output yet
.....





Long term vision: Create a Android app which will take a snapshot of a puzzle as input and display a resolution
